                    <h2>Caroline de Boutiny</h2>
                    <p>Hailing from Arles, the smells, tastes, and colors of the south of France are rooted deeply in her heart.
                         This is how Caroline turned, very early on, towards the passion-career known as Perfumery
                         . After completing her university studies, she became a student-perfumer at the
                          Grasse Institute of Perfumery. Her various professional experiences have led her as far
                           as England, but they always bring her back to Grasse! 

                            For over 10 years now, Caroline has been putting her energy, creativity, and efficiency
                             at Galimard’s service. Designing, formulating, regulating, and organizing are only a few 
                             of her duties. It is through her listening skills, her strong analytic abilities,
                              and her knowledge of materials and fits that Caroline is able to share with you her
                               passion for her career as a Perfumer.</p>

                    <h2>Irina Zhurikhina-Nesa</h2>
                    <p>Only once she’d gotten her master’s in Organic Chemistry in Russia 
                        did Irina decide to further her studies at the Grasse Institute of Perfumery and become a Perfumer.

                            A skilled pianist, her creative path would then lead her from Grasse to
                             Saint Petersburg for a creative project combining music and perfumes, via Saint Emilion as 
                             an olfactory advisor for wine assembly.
                            
                            The winner of Perfume Night in Grasse in 2010, she was also a finalist at the 
                            “art and olfaction awards” in 2017.
                            
                            It is through her great keenness and sensitivity that Irina is able to reawaken your 
                            olfactory memory and make you experience fantastic perfumed sensation</p>
